# Good_Match_program
This project calculates the good match percetange from an input CSV file and produces a sorted output file. It includes functions to calculate the good match percentage between two names, to check if a given string has only alphabetical characters in it and a fucntion to give the index value of the maximum value of an integer string.

## Instructions to run this code:
1. Download the project as a zip file
2. Extract the zip file
3. Open the Java project in an IDE of your choosing (I used IntelliJ). Note: you will need to open the "Good_Match_program-master" folder that is within the main folder (it should have 3 folders within it).
4. If you would like to use the input file already in the folder: Run "Matching_Main". It takes Names.csv as the input and stores the output in Output.txt. Any errors are stored in Log.txt.
5. If you would like to use your own csv input file: Run "Variable_Input". It will ask you to input a file location on the terminal. This can be retrieved by copying the path from Windows explorer, but relative references will also work. It will take your input and store the matched names in Output.txt. Any errors are stored in Log.txt.
